## Description
The CheckApp records the attendance of FMM students in distance learning classes, due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The app was developed on native Android along with the Java language and, for data storage, Firebase was used. In order to notify the student that a class had been booked by the teacher, Firebase's In-App Messaging was used to send a push notification directly to the student's device registered in the teacher's subject.
